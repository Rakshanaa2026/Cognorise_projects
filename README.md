#BREAST CANCER PREDICTION
The dataset is taken from kaggle which contains 31 features to predict whether a person is diagonized with breast cancer or not.I have used matplotlib libraries to check the correlation of the columns. I have used Logistic Regression as well as Random Forest Classifier to check which gives better accuracy. Suprisingly both gives the same accuracy.
If any betterment or clarifications to ping me!
