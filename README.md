#BREAST CANCER PREDICTION
The dataset is taken from kaggle which contains 31 features to predict whether a person is diagonized with breast cancer or not.I have used matplotlib libraries to check the correlation of the columns. I have used Logistic Regression as well as Random Forest Classifier to check which gives better accuracy. Suprisingly both gives the same accuracy.


#DIABETES PREDICTION
Again the dataset is taken from kaggle which contains 9 features with 100000 rows to predict whether a person is has diabetes or not.I have used matplotlib libraries to visualize the correlation between the columns and to show the accuracy of each model. I have used Random Forest Classfier as well as K Nearest Neighbours Classifier. Out of which Random Forest Classifier proves to provide more accurate results!


#SPAM EMAIL DETECTION
The dataset is taken from kaggle which contains only 2 columns to predict whether a email is spam or not.I have used TfidfVectorizer to convert the strings and then used logistic regression algorithm to train the model.

If any queries ping me!
